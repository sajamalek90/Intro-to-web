                        A user agent, usually a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a 
                        request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and <span>the server responds</span> with the content 
                        of that resource or an error message. A web server can also <span>accept and store resources</span> sent 
                        from the user agent if configured to do so.</p>

                    <h3>(2) URL</h3>

                        and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to
                         transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol 
                         stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then 
                         sends a response message.</p>

                    <p>Server-side processing is a technique used in web development where the server performs calculations,

                            easy to maintain, but they can be less interactive than dynamic sites.</li>
                        <li><span>Dynamic Sites:</span> are websites that change frequently, often in response
                            to user input or other events. They are built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                            and a server-side programming language, such as PHP or Python. Dynamic sites are more interactive
                            than static sites, but they can be slower and more difficult to maintain.</li>
